      <p class="introduction"> In Girl Scouts, the individual troops are on their own and the leader must manage a lot of paperwork. 
          Including a calander of events and plan meetings. I would like to learn how to create a website that can be used by the 
          troops and make sure that it is also secure and a good resource for the troop to share information and pictures with each other. </p> 
      <ol class="lesson-steps">
        <li>
          <div class="lesson-step">
            <p>The first step of CSI planning is declaring a <a href="https://tlacashleyb.weebly.com/the-4ms.html">4M</a> learning objective. This is the goal that all of the other activities in the lesson support.</p>
            <img src="lesson-plan-1.jpg" alt="lesson objective on whiteboard" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="lesson-step">
            <p>Next, identify a brief assessment that will give you data on which students have met the objective, which students need more assistance, and what specific issues people are having. This is a check for understanding, and makes up the "C" in CSI planning.</p>

          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="lesson-step">
            <p>Now that you've clarified what you want to teach and how you'll measure success, come up with a <a href="https://tlacstrategiesbetsylawson.wordpress.com/the-hook-strategy/">hook</a>. This is a brief but engaging way to start the lesson. It can be a thought-provoking question, a hands-on activity, or a demonstration. The important things are that it primes the students for the rest of the lesson and requires thinking from every student.</p>
            <img src="lesson-plan-3.jpg" alt="writing a hook on whiteboard" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="lesson-step">
            <p>Next, decide which activities you will do to get students ready to pass your check for understanding. Each step should describe what the student ("S") is doing and what the instructor ("I") is doing during that step. These need to be done in concert, but prioritize student activity. If you notice that you're doing too much "teacher talks / students listen", reimagine the step as something more active for the students.</p>
            <img src="lesson-plan-4.jpg" alt="writing steps on whiteboard" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="lesson-step">
            <p>Last, look at the entire lesson as a unit. Are the students active enough? Are the activities sufficient to prepare for the check for understanding? Are any activities unnecessary? Do the steps flow well? Is the hook engaging enough? What other activities will you want to have ready to remediate with if it turns out students don't understand?</p>
            <img src="lesson-plan-5.jpg" alt="entire lesson plan on whiteboard" />
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="review">Once the plan is complete, keep it somewhere easy for you to see during the lesson. Don't be afraid to deviate from the plan as new opportunities and challenges present themselves, but also take time after the lesson to revise your plan based on what you learned so you can use it next time.</p>
