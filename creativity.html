      <h2><em>Troop Website</em></h2>
      <p class="introduction"> In Girl Scouts, the individual troops are on their own, and the leader must manage and maintain a lot of paperwork. 
          Including a calandar of events and planned meetings. I would like to learn how to create a website that can be used by the 
          troops and make sure that it is also secure and a good resource for the troop to share information and pictures. </p> 
      <ol class="ideas">
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>To create a website designed for a Girl Scout Troop, we need to 
              start with how girls can join by giving a link to the main website such, as
               <a href="https://gsmidtn.org">Girl Scouts of Middle Tennessee.</a> 
              We will also need a description of the local troop and a place where troop families can log in.
             </p>

                </a>
             </figure>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The second page of our website would begin the secure pages that only the troop families can access.
              The Events page will include an interactive calendar that can list all troop meetings 
             and any special events. When the leaders need feedback on a future event, the page could contain
             voting buttons to assist in some decisions for the troop.
            </p>

              </a>
            </figure>
      
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The third page is about the fundraisers, and it would help the fall product mom or cookie mom
               if there is a form that allows parents to put each item's totals and then generates a final report to the 
               mom overseeing that fundraiser. It would make ordering from the council easier. 
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The fourth page will be our troop directory, including all members' names, addresses, email, and contact numbers. 
              The directory will make it easier for everyone to get in touch with each other. We could also add a title column to 
              add a person's role within the troop.

          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The final page of our troop website must be a photo and video gallery. Not all parents get to go to the 
              different events. The parents that do will usually take pictures and videos to share. This page would allow troop 
              parents to upload and share the images and videos with everyone.

      <p class="review">When I learn how to code, I plan to create this website and demonstrate this to the Girl Scout 
        Council. Since this will contain links and images from Girl Scouts, I will need to get their permission in order 
        for it to be for troop use.
