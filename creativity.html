      <h2><em>Creativity</em></h2>
      <p class="introduction"> In Girl Scouts, the individual troops are on their own, and the leader must manage and maintain much paperwork. 
          Including a calandar of events and planned meetings. I would like to learn how to create a website that can be used by the 
          troops and make sure that it is also secure and a good resource for the troop to share information and pictures. </p> 
      <ol class="ideas">
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>To create a website designed for a Girl Scout Troop, we need to 
              start with how girls can join by giving a link to the main website such, as
               <a href="https://gsmidtn.org">Girl Scouts of Middle Tennessee.</a> 
              We will also need a description of the local troop and a place for troop families can log in.
             </p>
            <img src="images/picture 1.jpg" alt="Troop Introduction" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The second link or page on our website should begin the secure pages that only the troop families have access.
               The Events page will include an interactive calandar that can list all troop meetings 
              and any special events. When the leaders need feedback on a future event, the page should contain
              voting buttons to assist in some decisions for the troop.
            </p>
            <img src="images/picture 2.jpg" alt="Events" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The third link is about the fundraisers, and it would help the fall product mom or the cookie mom
              if there is a form that allows parents to put the totals of each item and then generates a final report to
              the mom who is overseeing that fundraiser. It would make ordering from the council easier. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/picture 3.jpg" alt="Fundraisers" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The fourth link will be our troop directory, including all members' names, addresses, email, and contact numbers. 
              The directory will make it easier for everyone to get in touch with each other. We could also add a title column to 
              add a person's role within the troop.
            </p>
            <img src="images/picture 4.jpg" alt="Team Directory" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The final page of our troop website must be a photo and video gallery. Not all parents get to go to the 
              different events. The parents that do will usually take pictures and videos to share. This page would allow troop 
              parents to upload and share the images and videos with everyone.
            </p>
            <img src="images/picture 5.jpg" alt="Photo and Video gallary" />
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="review">When I learn how to code, I plan to create this website and demonstrate this to the Girl Scout 
        Council. Since this will contain links and images from Girl Scouts, I will need to get their permission in order 
        for it to be for troop use.
