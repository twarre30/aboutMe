      <h2><em>Creativity</em></h2>
      <p class="introduction"> In Girl Scouts, the individual troops are on their own and the leader must manage a lot of paperwork. 
          Including a calander of events and plan meetings. I would like to learn how to create a website that can be used by the 
          troops and make sure that it is also secure and a good resource for the troop to share information and pictures with each other. </p> 
      <ol class="ideas">
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>In order to create a website designed for a Girl Scout Troop we need to 
              start with how girls can join by giving a link to the main website such as
               <a href="https://gsmidtn.org">Girl Scounts of Middle Tennessee.</a> 
              We will also need a description of the local troop and a place for troop families can log into.
             </p>

          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The next link or page in our website should begin the secure pages that only the troop families have access
              to. This will be the Events page that will include an interactive calander that can list all troop meetings, 
              and any special events. If the leaders needs to get feedback on a future event than the page should contain
              voting buttons and feedback will sent to the leader.
            </p>
            <img src="images/picture 2.jpg" alt="Second page, creative thoughts on paper." />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>The third link is about the fund raisers and it would help the the fall product mom or the cookie mom
              if there is a form that allows parents to put the totals of each item and then generates a final report to
              the mom who is overseeing that fund raiser. It would make ordering from council easier. 
            </p>
            <img src="images/picture 3.jpg" alt="Third page, creative thoughts on paper" />
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>Next, decide which activities you will do to get students ready to pass your check for understanding. Each step should describe what the student ("S") is doing and what the instructor ("I") is doing during that step. These need to be done in concert, but prioritize student activity. If you notice that you're doing too much "teacher talks / students listen", reimagine the step as something more active for the students.</p>

          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="step">
            <p>Last, look at the entire lesson as a unit. Are the students active enough? Are the activities sufficient to prepare for the check for understanding? Are any activities unnecessary? Do the steps flow well? Is the hook engaging enough? What other activities will you want to have ready to remediate with if it turns out students don't understand?</p>

          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="review">Once the plan is complete, keep it somewhere easy for you to see during the lesson. Don't be afraid to deviate from the plan as new opportunities and challenges present themselves, but also take time after the lesson to revise your plan based on what you learned so you can use it next time.</p>
