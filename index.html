        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <img id= "profile-picture" src="images/me3.jpg" alt="Tiffany Warren"/>
        <p>
            In 2016, I decided to return to college and learn more about computers.
            I took a couple of internetworking classes then took Introduction to Web Development and Python. That is 
            when I decided that my next career would be software engineering. I enjoy creating things that will help people.
            I continue to study coding outside of school, with applications like Mimo and Sololearn. 
        </p>
        <h2><em>My Goals</em></h2>
        <p>
            I want to be a software engineer to create programs that help people connect and make their lives easier. 
            As a Lifetime Girl Scout member, I am always trying to find better ways to do things that leave a smaller footprint in our world.
            I enjoy teaching new innovative ways to do things, as the girls are the future leaders of our world. We need to be at the top
            of our knowledge gain and grow as our world changes to a more digital lifestyle. Life is about learning, and learning is life.
