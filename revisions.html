        <h2>Revisions to this Site</h2>
        <p style="max-width: fit-content;">I asked my partner, James Price, and my co-work Brad for feedback on this site. At the time, the troop website page looked like this:</p>
        <a href="images/beforeRevision.png" target="_blank"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/beforeRevision.png" /></a>
        <aside>
            <p class="feedback">He identified the following issues:</p>
            <ul class="thoughts">
                <li>
                 The first thing that he saw was that the blue font was difficult to read with a yellow background.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Had a few grammar issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                 He indicated that the images were too small to read and unclear, would like them clearer or be able to open in
                 a new window.
                </li>
                 <li>
                 He thought everything centered looked odd on the page and left a lot of empty space.  
                 </li>
                 <li>
                 He stated that the navigation links are lost in the background, need to make them more visible.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                    Brad suggested that I set the Girl Scouts of Middle Tennessee link to blank so that 
                    it will open in a new window.   
                 </li>
             </ul>
        </aside>
     
        

        <p style="max-width: fit-content;">After revising the site to account for this feedback, I ended up with the following layout:</p>
        
        
        
        <a href="images/afterRevisions.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="images/afterRevisions.png" /></a>
        <aside>
            <p>How I used the feedback to make my website better.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Remove the inline style for the page. To return to the default font to match other pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With the help of Grammarly, corrected the various grammar issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Increased the width of the images, and also made them clickable to open in a new window.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Changed the ordered list to display: flex. Now the paragraphs are on the left and images on the right.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a background color and border to the nav content, added a border-radius. Added some padding, to help center
                    the links. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    I corrected the Girl Scouts of Middle Tennessee link to include a target of blank so that it will open in a new window.
                </li>
            </ul>
